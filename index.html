        <h2>Software Engineering Intern</h2>
        <h3>May 2022&rarr;July 2022 • Norton Life Lock</h3>
        <p>
          • Scripted a way to interact with the SendGrid (Twilio) API to make
          managing email templates seamless through a simple GUI. The script
          would automatically upload and verify the accuracy of the templates,
          while version controlling previous ones, with minimal human
          interaction. Ultimately helping to reduce errors in both production
          and staging environments by over 50%. <br />
          <br />
          • Deployed this solution to a Jenkins pipeline using a declarative
          groovy script, contributing to the goal of having Jenkins be where
          everything is accessed.

        <h2>Innovation Intern</h2>
        <h3>Jan 2022 &rarr; May 2022 • Ameren</h3>
        <p>
          • Led the design and implementation of migrating Ameren’s suite of
          Angular web applications to a continuous integration, deployment, and
          testing solution using the AWS services of Lambda, S3, CodeBucket,
          CodePipeline, CodeWatch, and CodeBuild in conjunction with Selenium
          for a 95% reduction in time-to-delivery. <br />
          <br />
          • Designed an API to autonomously generate code documentation for
          Ameren’s Python projects and packages; using Sphinx in combination
          with GitActions to automate the compilation of code on pushes to the
          master branch of a Git repository, ultimately improving code
          comprehension and speeding up documentation processes.

        <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
        <h3>September 2021 &rarr; Present • IEEE @ UIUC</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://ieee.illinois.edu">ieee.illinois.edu</a> <br />
          <br />
          • Executed a complete rebuild of IEEE’s website using Node.js, React,
          Express, and MongoDB for increased visibility and a 100% increased
          member engagement in club events (google analytics) <br />
          <br />
          • Created a Rest API backend with CRUD functionality, boosting
          productivity by streamlining content updates through a GUI vs hard
          coding and redeploying the website, overall reducing the time to
          update the site by 80% <br />
          <br />
          • Wrote a Node.js Cron job, leveraging Twilio to autonomously text
          meeting reminders to members who signed up for text alerts, increasing
          attendance rates by 25%

        <h3>October 2021 &rarr; December 2021 • Smith Research Group</h3>
        <p>
          • Collected and visualized data with Python and Matplotlib to optimize
          flow rate into a desalination chamber, ultimately improving
          desalinization efficiency and reducing wear and tear on parts

          <br />
          • Developed a website in React, incorporating state management through
          Redux and styling with SCSS, leading to the company’s increased
          visibility and presence on the web. • Facilitated communication
          between the project lead and our team of interns, leading to faster
          development time and increased transparency among co-workers.
